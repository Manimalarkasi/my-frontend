        <p class="para1">hii The defending champions find themselves staring at 
            elimination with just two points on the board and currently sit in ninth place
            . Only the Netherlands are behind them in the table, and that is only on the net run rate (NRR).
             With just four matches left, England's prospects for the semi-final are hanging by a thread.</p>
    <p class="para2">The maximum point England can now reach is 10 points, which India is already on.
         It is worth pointing out that New Zealand did qualify on 11 points,
         but Pakistan missed out on the same tally. While the 2019 edition had four washouts,
          any such possibility looks difficult this time around.</p>
          <p class="para3">England have a tough fixture list coming up with a battle against table-toppers 
            India on Sunday (October 29) in Lucknow before they travel to Ahmedabad to face Australia
             on November 4 before a game against the Netherlands in Pune on November 8 before their 
             last game against Pakistan in Kolkata on November 11.</p>
             <p class="para4">Talking about the match, England won the toss and chose to bat. However,
                 their batting unit failed to fire and was bowled out for 157. Sri Lanka chased the target with ease as they 
                won by eight wickets with 146 balls to spare. This is the fifth consecutive
                 ODI World Cup match in which England have lost to Sri Lanka.</p>
