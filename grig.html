        efore the start of the World Cup, two teams were a common pick among every single predictions 
        made by veteran cricketers and experts. But the two eventually incurred contrasting paths. India,
         who were touted to emulate their 2011 feat as mere hosts again 
        and based on their run-up to the World Cup, has already emerged as almost a certainty for the knockouts.

        he 2019 champions, who lost three of their opening four matches, sit at the bottom 
        half of the table. England were defeated by New Zealand in the tournament opener in what
         was an avengful victory for Blackcaps in repeat of the 2019 final.

        England recovered to beat Bangladesh in their second game, but were left stunned by 
        Afghanistan with a 69-run defeat before South Africa added to
         their embarrassment with a record 229-run loss, the biggest ever the team incurred in ODI cricket.

        England still have five more games to play and an array of wins could leave them with 
        a good chance to make the knockout stage of the World Cup.
         If they win all their remaining five matches in the tournament, they will be left
          with a maximum of 12 points,

        England would also want to keep net run rate in mind in securing their victories in the
         remaining matches as it tends to play an influential role in the final stages of the league phase.
          England's present NRR of -1.247 is only better than Bangladesh (-1.253) and Netherlands (-1.902),
         both of whom have same points as Jos Buttler's men, albeit from five matches each.

        For me, my Sanatana Dharma is above everything. I am not saying anything wrong or making things up.
         I will raise my voice if anything wrong happens.
        There are a number of cases in Pakistan like these that have not even been reported.
